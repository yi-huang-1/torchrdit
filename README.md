# TorchRDIT

This is a private repository for developing and testing an inverse design package
for periodic structure inverse design purpose. The EM algorithms used in this
package are Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and Rigorous Diffraction
Interface Theory (R-DIT). The solver is developed on an automatic differentiable
framework (PyTorch) and is fully differentiable for more advanced applications.
