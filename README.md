`TorchRDIT` is an advanced software package designed for the inverse design of meta-optics devices, utilizing an eigendecomposition-free implementation of Rigorous Diffraction Interface Theory (R-DIT). It provides a GPU-accelerated and fully differentiable framework powered by PyTorch, enabling the efficient optimization of photonic structures.

This framework achieves up to 16.2Ã— speedup compared to traditional inverse design methods based on Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA). By integrating differentiable R-DIT with topology optimization techniques and neural networks (e.g., SIREN), TorchRDIT facilitates the design of complex meta-optics devices, including:

- Parameter-constrained and free-form meta-atoms.
- Reconfigurable photonic structures using optical phase-change materials.
- High-performance meta-lenses and beam deflectors.

With its focus on computational efficiency and flexibility, TorchRDIT lays the foundation for next-generation metasurface design workflows, offering capabilities for the creation of intricate and multifunctional photonic devices.

`TorchRDIT` is used for the papers:
