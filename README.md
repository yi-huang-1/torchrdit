# TorchRDIT

`TorchRDIT` is a software package for the paper:
<PlaceHolder>

The EM algorithms used in this package are Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and Rigorous Diffraction
Interface Theory (R-DIT). The solver is developed on an automatic differentiable
framework (PyTorch) and is fully differentiable for more advanced applications.
