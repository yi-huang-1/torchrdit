"""TorchRDIT: GPU-accelerated electromagnetic solver for meta-optics design.

TorchRDIT is an advanced software package designed for the inverse design of 
meta-optics devices, utilizing an eigendecomposition-free implementation of 
Rigorous Diffraction Interface Theory (R-DIT). It provides a GPU-accelerated 
and fully differentiable framework powered by PyTorch, enabling efficient 
optimization of photonic structures.

This package achieves up to 16.2Ã— speedup compared to traditional inverse design 
methods based on Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA). By integrating differentiable 
R-DIT with topology optimization techniques and neural networks, TorchRDIT facilitates 
the design of complex meta-optics devices.

Key modules:
- solver: Core electromagnetic solvers (RCWA and R-DIT)
- algorithm: Algorithm implementations for field calculations
- materials: Material property definitions and management
- cell: Geometric cell definitions for simulations
- layers: Layer management for multilayer structures
- utils: Utility functions for calculations
- viz: Visualization tools for results
- builder: Builder pattern implementation for solver creation
