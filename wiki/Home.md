# TorchRDIT Documentation

Welcome to the `TorchRDIT` documentation. `TorchRDIT` is an advanced software package designed for the inverse design of meta-optics devices, utilizing an eigendecomposition-free implementation of Rigorous Diffraction Interface Theory (R-DIT). It provides a GPU-accelerated and fully differentiable framework powered by PyTorch, enabling the efficient optimization of photonic structures.

## Key Features

- **Differentiable**: Built on PyTorch for seamless integration with deep learning and optimization
- **High-Performance**: Efficient implementations of RCWA and RDIT algorithms
- **Flexible**: Support for complex geometries, dispersive materials, and various layer structures
- **Extensible**: Easy to integrate into machine learning and inverse design workflows
